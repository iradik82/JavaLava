Polymorphism:
  polymorphism is the ability of a method to take on many forms based on the object or the parameters that we pass
  to the method.
Types of polymorphism :
  there are two types of polymorphism.
  1)compile time/static/early binding
     * When we use method overloading to achieve polymorphism it is called compile polymorphism.
  2)run time/dynamic or late binding.
     *when we use method overriding to achieve polymorphism then it is called run time polymorphism.
