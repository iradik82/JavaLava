Why we should learn about the methods:
   Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write. For example if
   a piece of code is being repeated. We can create a method for it and simple call that method
   whenever we need that logic again;
Syntax of creating a method:
  we can create methods only inside a class.
  [datatype] [method name] [(datatype variableName)][method body]
  [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
  [method name] They ara like variable names.
  [(datatype variableName)] used to pass data while calling method.
How do we decide that we should use void or a method with a return keyword1:
  if we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code which
  require some data from your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void
  type

================================================================================
Types of variables with respect to their scope:
    there are three types of variables w.r.t. their scope.
    1) local variables.
    2) instance variable.
    3) static variables.
1)Local variables:
    A variable that is created inside a method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable.
  When we should use local variables:
    Local variable occupy the computers memory for the shortest amount of time. We should always go with
    Local Variables if it possible,but they are limited in scope we can't use local variables outside the
    block in which they are declare

    for (int i=0;i<5;i++){
    System.out.println(i);
    }

2)Instance variable:
   Which are declared outside of a block of code but inside the class are called instance variables.
 When we should use instance variables:
   when we are planing to create multiple objects of a class, or we want to share something in
   multiple methods we should go with instance variables. They occupy the memory for longer as compared to
   local variables.

3)static variables:
   if an instance variable has a keyword static with if it's called a static variable.
 When we should use static variables:
   When we need to share something across the objects. We use static variables.
   but it occupies the memory for longest amount of time
