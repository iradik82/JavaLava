"This" keyword:
  "this" is a keyword like "class","void". it is used in many places.for example
  if we have same name instance and a local variable can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable.
  We can use "this()" to cal a constructor inside another constructor.
why should we learn about "this" keyword:
  1)it allows us to have same name local and instance variable.
  2)if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another
  constructor by writing "this()".
  
"Super" keyword:
  we use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable  from the parent class. when we have
  same name instance variable in child class and parent class.
  we can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.


  Final Keyword:
    final keyword is just like any other keyword in Java like class package void etc.
    there are three man uses of final keyword.
    1)if we use final keyword with a class no other class can inherit from that class.
    2)If we use it with a method name no child class can override that method.
    3)if we use it with a field  once the value has been assigned  to that field no one can change it value afterwards

  final static variables - constants
  constants we write using UPPERCASE
      -final public static boolean FRESH=true;
      -final public static boolean CAN_EAT=true;
           *you can not change value of variables

       METHODS() with final keyword can't be override

Inheritance:
  Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
     There are 4 types of inheritance.
     1)Single inheritance:
       * we can have only 1 parent and 1 child class.
     2)Multilevel Inheritance:
       * we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather->father->son->grand son
     3)Hierarchical inheritance:
       * one parent clas and multiple direct child classes.
     4)Multiple inheritance:
       * one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not supported by java
       because of diamond problem
why should we learn inheritance?
  it allows to reduce the duplicate code.
what is the syntax?
  we can use this feature by writing "extends" keyword when declaring a class.
