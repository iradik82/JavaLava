Access Modifiers:
  Acces modifiers are keywords in java that control the access of methods fields or the class itself.
  Ther are four access levels.
Private:
  if something has the access level of private that thing can only be accessed within the same class.
  This access level is the most restricted one. For fields/properties/state of a class, we should always try to have private access level
  so that secured.
Default:
  Default is not a keyword.it's an access level.if we don't use any keyword with fields or methods java the default
  access level automatically. Once applied we can access those entities within the same class as well as in any class within teh same
  package
Protected:
  When applied entities can be accessed outside of the package as well but only on the class that have parent-child relationship.
