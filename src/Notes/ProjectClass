2. A constructor in Java is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.
Unlike Java methods,a constructor has the same name as that of the class and does not have any return type.
We use the constructor to initialize variables

3. In java, super keyword is used to access methods of the parent class while this is used to access methods
of the current class.this keyword is a reserved keyword in java i.e, we can't use it as an identifier.
It is used to refer current class's instance as well as static members

4. Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes;
for example, the relationship between father and son.
Inheritance in Java is a process of acquiring all the behaviours of a parent object.

Single, Multiple, Multilevel & Heirical

5. Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name,
 but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number
of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.
 Method overloading is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism,
 or Early binding in Java

6. method overriding occurs when a subclass (child class) has the same method as the parent class.
And  is giving its own implementation to the method.
When we create an object of the child class java will give preference to the method on a child class over the parent

7. Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows
 a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times.
 Polymorphism is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface
 for several different underlying data types.


8. The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods,
 which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value,
