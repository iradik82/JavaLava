FileHandling:
    Reading writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling.
Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1)location of file on our computer.
    2) we need to go to that location.
    3) we need a software that can read and write data to that file for exmaple we need Microsoft Excel if we
    want to work with xlsx files.

Why we learn FileHandLing:
   1)When we perform data diven testing we need to store data in files.
   2)Storing critical data like userNames and password inside the code is bad,because when we push the code to github
   that info will be pushed with it, to avoid this we use properties files.
   3)Sometimes data can be huge in GBs,and it's very bad practice to push GBS to GitHub.

How can we read data from file?
  1)First we need to know the location(path) of the file.
  2)Navigate to that location where file is stored.
  3)We need a special class/Software that can help us read/write to that file.
