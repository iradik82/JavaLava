Inheritance:
  Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
     There are 4 types of inheritance.
     1)Single inheritance:
       * we can have only 1 parent and 1 child class.
     2)Multilevel Inheritance:
       * we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather->father->son->grand son
     3)Hierarchical inheritance:
       * one parent clas and multiple direct child classes.
     4)Multiple inheritance:
       * one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not supported by java
       because of diamond problem
why should we learn inheritance?
  it allows to reduce the duplicate code.
what is the syntax?
  we can use this feature by writing "extends" keyword when declaring a class.

Why we should learn inheritance?
    It helps use avoid code duplication.
    It helps us save space.
    It helps us improve the execution speed.
