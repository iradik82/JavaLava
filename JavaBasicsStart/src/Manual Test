Class 2 - Manual Testing
Recap --
Why do we need to test?
To assure the quality of the software, we need to test it.
STLC -
requirement analysis - We analyse the requirements based on the smart 
criteria
test planning - test plan - Test/QA Lead/ manager
test case development -
Testing heirarchy -
Dev - where developers develop the application
Test/qa - where QA engineers perform testing
Staging/cert/qual/MR3 - where client testers perform testing/uat testing
production - it is live environment

What we should do when we found a bug?
Verify if it is reproducible or not
Read the req to make sure that the bug you found is actually a bug
intermittent bugs (sometimes they appear sometimes they don't)
BUG LIFE CYCLE
How to report it?
COLLECT AS MUCH AS INFORMATION POSSIBLE:
- exact steps we took to reproduce the bug
- Browser, time, the environment, test data, logs, screenshots or screen 
recording
Severity - the seriousness of the defect
Priority - it defines the order in which our bug should be fixed
Cucumber / BDD / Gherkin
It allows you to write test cases/scenarios in simple plain english 
sentences


Every scenario in BDD represents a Test case
Given - it represents pre condition  (pre condition)
When - to perform actions            (to perform actions)
Then - expected result               (Expected results)
And - supporting tag                 (supporting tag)


Scenario - Verify the login functionality for amazon
Given user is able to access amazon application in browser
When user enters username in username textfield
And user enters password in password textfield
And user clicks on login button
Then user should be able to see home page

it is recommended and best practice to write cucumber scenarios in third 
person point of view

it is used to describe business rules


Types of testing -
2 types -
Functional - to check the functionality of the application
non-functional - backend testing behind the scenes
Regression testing - testing the complete functionality/ all the 
test cases called regression testing
unit testing
integration testing
system testing
Smoke testing
UAT


Class 4 Manual testing 

Integration testing
performance testing
508 Compliance testing
ad hoc testing - exploratory testing, informal testing - 


project management tool


HP ALM - application lifecycle management
HP QC
Devops Azure
Rally
Trello
JIRA

Why Project management tool?

to see the project status
reporting purpose
user stories,spring


Class 5 Manual test

Acceptance criteria

DOR - Definition of ready - when scrum team gets complete details about the user
                              story and estimated it properly for taking up for the development
DOD - Definition of done -  when development is done, testing is done, status of all test cases for 
                              this user story is green and code is committed , then DOD is completed.



Agile ceremonies

Product backlog - it has all the product user story items
Sprint  backlog - we take only those items we will work on during spring


Sprint planning -
